useState , useEffect ,useRef .... -> core React hooks
useMemo -> cache the result of a calculation b/w re-renders
ex - calculating nth prime takes time for large n value so we need memo
we want to access DOM element
in Ref.js for change in Y the x value before is gone due to re-renders
this is the problem -> so use the hook useRef
