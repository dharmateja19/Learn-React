cleanup - when we have setInterval we have to use clearInterval in componentwillunmount
componentwillunmount
useEffect and componentdidmount are not same 
for multiple useEffects we have to use that many if conditionals in componentdidupdate
cleanup in functional component is done using return ()=>{}
